    "prompt": "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\n\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\nYou can return the answer in any order.",

    "reasoning": "While the interview appears to have been conducted in a professional manner with no obvious bias or inappropriate questions, the candidate's performance does not meet the high bar for a passing recommendation. The raw scores of 5/10 across all categories indicate the candidate struggled significantly with the problem and was unable to provide a working solution. The lack of any code submission further confirms the candidate did not successfully solve the problem. Even though no hints were provided, the candidate's problem-solving and communication skills were not strong enough to warrant a passing recommendation. The scores accurately reflect the candidate's limited ability to tackle this easy-level problem. Given the clear evidence of the candidate's inability to solve the problem, a FAIL recommendation is appropriate, despite the lack of bias in the interview process. More practice and preparation would be needed for the candidate to demonstrate the required level of technical competence."
