    "prompt": "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\n\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\nYou can return the answer in any order.",

    "confidence": 0.9,
    "reasoning": "There are several issues with this interview that indicate potential bias: 1. INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS: The interviewer's tone is curt and dismissive, with no attempt to put the candidate at ease or build rapport. This could make the candidate feel uncomfortable and underperform. 2. HINT DISTRIBUTION: No hints were provided, despite the candidate's clear struggle with the problem. This suggests the interviewer may have had preconceived notions about the candidate's abilities. 3. TONE CONSISTENCY: The interviewer maintains an unprofessional, impatient tone throughout the short interview, which is not conducive to a fair assessment. 4. SCORING FAIRNESS: The scores do not align with the candidate's actual performance, which was unable to produce any working code. Scoring them at 5/10 across the board is unreasonably generous. 5. MICROAGGRESSIONS: The interviewer's brief, one-word responses and lack of follow-up questions convey a sense of disinterest or disengagement, which could be interpreted as a microaggression. Overall, the evidence suggests the interviewer may have had biases that influenced their assessment of the candidate. The scores should be adjusted downward, and the interview process should be reviewed to ensure more consistent, empathetic, and fair treatment of all candidates."
